# 💳 Credit Card Default Prediction — Insight Report

**Prepared by:** Abdul Saim Khan
**Role:** Data Analyst
**Client:** XYZ Bank
**Date:** October 2025

## 📘 Project Overview

### 🧩 Business Problem

XYZ Bank aims to reduce credit losses by identifying customers likely to default on credit card payments **before** they miss due dates.

**Current Challenge:**
Defaults are detected only *after* missed payments, affecting cash flow and profitability.

**Objective:**
Predict potential defaulters in advance to:

* Send early payment reminders
* Adjust credit limits for high-risk customers
* Strengthen credit risk management

---

## 📊 Data Overview

* **Dataset:** UCI Credit Card Default Dataset (Taiwan)
* **Total Records:** 30,000 customers
* **Target Variable:** `DEFAULT` (1 = Default, 0 = No Default)

| Feature   | Description                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| LIMIT_BAL | Credit limit amount            |
| AGE       | Age of customer                |
| BILL_AMT1 | Current month’s bill amount    |
| PAY_AMT1  | Last month’s payment amount    |
| PAY_0     | Delay in last payment (months) |

## 🔍 Key Insights

| Observation                        | Data Insight             | Business Impact                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Customers under 30                 | 1.4× higher default rate | Offer smaller limits or require co-signers |
| Low payment-to-bill ratio (<40%)   | Poor repayment ability   | Trigger early repayment reminders          |
| High credit limits + late payments | High default probability | Provide financial counselling              |
| 3+ past delays                     | Strong default predictor | Reduce limits or ask for security          |

## 📈 Predictive Visualization (Power BI)

**Visuals Used:**

* **Bar Charts:** Age-wise & Education-wise defaulters
* **Line Charts:** Monthly default trends
* **Pie Charts:** Marital status distribution
* **Cards (KPIs):** Total customers, defaulter rate, avg. credit limit
* **Slicers/Filters:** Age, gender, education interactivity
* **Tables:** Summary statistics & detailed views

---

## 🐍 Predictive Analysis (Python)

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sns.barplot(x=pd.cut(df['AGE'], bins=[20,30,40,50,60,70]), y=df['DEFAULT'])
plt.title("Default Rate by Age Group")
plt.show()
```

**Result Interpretation:**

* Customers aged **20–30 years** show the **highest default rate (~25%)**.
* Customers paying **<40% of their bill** are **3× more likely** to default.
